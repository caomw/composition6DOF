function C = calcCov(  C, Cnew, Jac1, Jac2 )
% This function builds the big covariance used in EKF
% INPUT:  C is the covariance Matrix from the previous iteration
%         Cnew is the covariance from the current state augmentation
%         Jac1 Jacobian of the composition with respect to the last item of
%              the state vector
%         Jac2 Jacobian of the composition with respect to the odometry
% Output: C the new covariance matrix

% C will be build as follows:
% C = | C(1,1)      C(1,2)      ... C(1,n)      C(1,n)*Jac1' |
%     | C(2,1)      C(2,2)      ... C(2,n)      C(2,n)*Jac1' |
%     |                         ...                          |
%     | C(m,1)      C(m,2)      ... C(m,n)      C(m,n)*Jac1' |
%     | Jac1*C(m,1) Jac1*C(m,2) ... Jac1*C(m,n) Cnew         |

sizeC = length(C)/7;

% Pushing the new covariance to C
    C( (sizeC+1)*7-6:(sizeC+1)*7, (sizeC+1)*7-6:(sizeC+1)*7 ) = Cnew;

% Put information to the last column and row of C
%     for i=1:sizeC
% %     column --> C(i,n+1) = C(i,n)*Jac1'
%         C( i*7-6:i*7, (sizeC+1)*7-6:(sizeC+1)*7 ) = C( i*7-6:i*7, sizeC*7-6:sizeC*7 ) ...
%                                                                    * Jac1';
% 
% %     row -----> C(m+1,i) = Jac1*C(m,1)
%         C( (sizeC+1)*7-6:(sizeC+1)*7, i*7-6:i*7 ) = Jac1 * ...
%                                           C( sizeC*7-6:sizeC*7, i*7-6:i*7);
%     end
