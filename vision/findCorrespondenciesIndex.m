function [inlierPtsLeft, inlierPtsRight, Rt, status, descLeft] = findCorrespondenciesIndex(f1, vpts1, f2, vpts2)
% This function finds the correspondencies between given features
% It also filters outliers and calculates the
% Rototranslation between this images. 
% IN :  f1 SURF descriptor of left Image
%       vpts1 SURFPoints of left Image
%       f2 SURF descriptor of right Image
%       vpts2 SURFPoints of right Image
% OUT:  inlierPtsLeft inliers of the left image in corresponding order as
%       SURFPoints
%       inlierPtsRight inliers of the right image in corresponding order as
%       SURFPoints
%       Rt Rototranslation between Images (provided but not used)
%       status tells us if correspondencies have been found (0 = no error,
%       1 = input does not contain enough points, 2 = Not enough inliers
%       have been found)
%       descLeft Surf Descriptors of left Image
   
%     I.  Retrieve the locations of matched points. The SURF feature vectors are already normalized.

    matchedPoints2 = vpts2(indexPairs(:, 2));
      
%     II.  Exclude the outliers, and compute the transformation matrix.
