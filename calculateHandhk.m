function [hk H zk numLC] = calculateHandhk( X, tMeasureOdo, timestampsLC, zk )
% This function calculates the relative estimated motion from with respect
% to the observed landmarks.
% INPUT  : X state vector containing all current states 
%          tMeasureOdo vector with corresponding timestamps 
%          timestampsLC vector with the timestamps of the loop closings
% OUTPUT : hk is the akkumulated estimation
%          H is the H Matrix as known from EKF
%          numLC tells us how many elements finally have been used for the
%           loop closing. In case not to each Image exists an Odometry or
%           vice versa.

%     a zero matrix

%     create H Matrix MxN, where M is the sice of loop closings times 7 and
%     N the number of states, because each entry in H will be 7x7:
%     this is the size of each Jacobians, because every state consist of 7
%     values
%     H = zeros( (length(timestampsLC) - 1)*7, length(X) );
    
%     create hk filled with zeros for easier access afterwards
%     hk = zeros( (length(timestampsLC)-1)*7,1);
%     load absolute motions from state vector
%     load reference state

%           If no odometry could be found corresponding to the loop closing
%           we need to discard this loop closing from the zk vector.
