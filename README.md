composition6DOF
===============

* IN PROGRESS
* Full 3D Frame Composition with six degrees of freedom
* Transformation Composition-Function using Quaternions
* Transformation Inversion-Function using Quaternions
* Jacobians
* Covariances
* A lot of Utilization-Function
	* relative motion from absolute motion 
 	* rosbag (visualodometry message) reader (really simple --> uses a pre-captured text file)
	* quaternion to rotation-matrix
	* invert quaternion
	* multiplication quaternion
* Simple Simulator
* Written in Matlab (should also work with Octave)
* More information can be taken from COMPOSITION.m
