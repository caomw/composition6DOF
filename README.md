composition6DOF
===============

* IN PROGRESS
* Full 3D Frame Composition with six degrees of freedom
* Transformation Composition-Function
* Transformation Inversion-Function
* Jacobians
* A lot of Utilization-Function

	*  relative motion from absolute motion 
	* relative motion from velocity
 	* rosbag (visualodometry message) reader (really simple $\hookrightarrow$ uses a pre-captured text file)
	* quaternion to euler
	* euler to quaternion
	* simple function to use matlabs symbolic toolbox
	* function to apply a 3D transformation matrix
	* ...

* Simple Simulator
* Written in Matlab (should also work with Octave)
